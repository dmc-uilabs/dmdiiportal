			      <h2>16 Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration</h2>
			      <strong><p>Please read this Section 16 carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with UI LABS.</p></strong>
			      <p>Except for small claims disputes in which you or UI LABS seek to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or UI LABS seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and UI LABS waive your rights whether through a jury trial or otherwise to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court. Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in Cook County, Illinois. in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("<strong>Rules</strong>") of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("<strong>JAMS</strong>"), which are available on the <strong><u><a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/" target="_blank"https://www.jamsadr.com>JAMS website and hereby incorporated by reference</a></u></strong>. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>
			      <strong><p>You and UI LABS agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and UI LABS and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.</p></strong>
			      <p>You and UI LABS agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 16 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the "<strong>FAA</strong>"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.  As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. If you are an individual user, you and UI LABS agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and UI LABS will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs; for any arbitration initiated by UI LABS, UI LABS will pay all JAMS fees and costs. In arbitrations involving entities, the party initiating arbitration will pay the filling fee and the non-prevailing party will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. You and UI LABS agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Illinois and the United States sitting in Cook County, Illinois  have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.</p>
			      <strong><p>Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise; the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and UI LABS will not have the right to assert the claim.</p></strong>
			      <p>You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty (30) days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 16 by emailing us at <strong><u><a href="mailto:askdmc@uilabs.org">askdmc@uilabs.org</a></u></strong>. In order to be effective, the opt out notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with Section 17.</p>

			      <h2>17 Governing Law and Venue</h2>
			      These Terms and your access to and use of our Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Illinois, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of Illinois or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

			      <a name="Section18"></a>

			      The following sections will survive the expiration or termination of these Terms and termination of your UI LABS account: all defined terms and Sections 1-5.1 (1st paragraph), 6-23.


			      <a name="Section23"></a>
			      <h2>23 Miscellaneous</h2>
			      These Terms, together with supplemental terms (if any), constitute the entire agreement between you and UI LABS relating to your access to and use of our Services. The failure of UI LABS to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.
