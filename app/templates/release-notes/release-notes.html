							<h2>What can I find here?</h2>
					<h3> On the portal you’ll find news, discussions, information about DMDII members, and details about the Institute’s projects.
<br /><br />
					The portal lists DMDII updates, milestones, and events in a single location so you never miss an announcement from the Institute or other members. A member directory hosts profiles of participating organizations—including their skills and interests—to help facilitate networking and project teaming. On the portal’s project page, you’ll find information about ongoing DMDII projects, from news and updates to timelines and events, to help keep you informed about the wide scope of projects underway at DMDII.</h3>

							<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
					<h3>	Begin by contacting your organization’s administrator for your credentials to access the portal. Once you’ve logged in, you’ll find an easy-to-use, customizable interface. Start by creating your profile to tell other members about you and your organization—who you are, what you do, and the skills you bring to DMDII.

						After your profile is up to date, engage with the DMDII community by following other members and participating in discussions within the forum. Update your projects on the “My Projects” tab, upload documents, and invite other members to engage with you in your work. Check back often for the latest news, discussions, and project updates posted to the portal.</h3>
