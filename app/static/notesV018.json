Our marketplace is slowly growing, this being the case, to make user's experience a much less click intensive one as well as to make their experience a better one when running applications that require file input, we have introduced the ability to let users reference documents in their workspaces as the input. This has not yet been rolled out to all applications as we are not yet hosting many applications that require file inputs, but as more applications become available, we want to make sure that applications have this feature already built out and ready to be utilized. In this release we also have introduced two applications into the DMC Marketplace that utilize this very feature.",
