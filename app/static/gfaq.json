      {"id":2,"q":"I've created an account and logged into the website, but I don't seem to have access or the ability to do anything all. Is the site broken?","a":"Our platform is currently in a closed beta. What this means for your account is that until your organization administrator verifies that you are a member of their organization, you will not be able to have access to the DMC. Currently the only organizations which have organization administrators to help you get through the verification process are DMDII member organizations. We do offer an alternative method to get access to our platform during our closed beta, where you need to associate your account with the Digital Manufacturing Commons organization and then e-mail us at <u><a href=\"mailto:askdmc@uilabs.org\" style=\"color:green\">askdmc@uilabs.org</a></u> to receive a verification token to give your account general site functionality."},
