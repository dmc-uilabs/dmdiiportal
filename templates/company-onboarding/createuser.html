         <p>Before you can create a company membership, you need to become a user of the Digital Manufacturing Commons.</p>

           The DMC uses federated authentication, which means your identity is verified by a third party (this may be your own organization or a service like Google or LinkedIn).
           If your organization has federated with the DMC, you will be able to log into the DMC using your organization credentials.
           If your organization has not federated with the DMC, you will still be able to log into the DMC using your choice of common third parties.
           Before logging into the DMC, make sure that you are not logged into any e-mail accounts in the browser you are using.
