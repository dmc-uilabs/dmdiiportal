                    <h2>Introduction and Historical Context</h2>
                    <p class="slim-margin">Our vision for the Digital Manufacturing Commons platform is to serve as the gateway to Digital Manufacturing and be a force for democratized access to best in breed tools and technologies. Our community is looking to us to provide
                        guidance and leadership in navigating the ever-evolving Digital Manufacturing landscape. We seek to highlight, showcase and expand the reach of innovative new approaches to learning, teaching and research that enable new forms
                        of collaboration and new solutions to be born from both novice and expert.</p>
                    <p class="slim-margin">Under the construct of DMDII projects we have been able to extend the DMC into the classroom and expose tomorrow's engineers to a new paradigm of digital work. Learners are exposed to the digital thread and how they can leverage our
                        platform to find, create and share solutions.</p>
                    <p class="slim-margin">In fulfilling our mission of sharing and collaboration, we endeavor to share these materials as a guide so that others may have an easier time learning and creating.</p>

                <h2>Syllabus Overview and Course Purpose:</h2>

                <p>Digital technologies influence every stage of product manufacturing, beginning from its conceptualization, to its manufacturing on a shop floor, its use by consumers and final disposal. Advances in computing, artificial intelligence,
                    automation and robotics and human-computer interaction have disrupted current manufacturing processes from the individual shop floor to the enterprise level. This digital connectivity between designers, production managers, supply
                    chain vendors and the physical industrial machines that produce the product will undoubtedly improve productivity. This course is first in a series of Smart Manufacturing based courses, which aims to introduce students on the power
                    of digital manufacturing and design technologies, particularly how product data can seamlessly transfer through the entire lifecycle of a manufactured product. All hands-on modeling and virtual manufacturing will be in Autodesk
                    Fusion 360, a cloud based design and manufacturing software. Students will be introduced to building apps that interact with 3D models and for process-monitoring applications. We will cover machine communication protocols in the
                    discrete manufacturing space, and how manufacturing data is used to improve shop-floor productivity.</p>
                <h2>Course Learning Objectives:</h2>
                <p>By the end of this course, the student will be able to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Describe Product Model Information (PMI) and Model Based Definition of Discrete Products.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating Fusion 360 Apps to interact with 3D Models for Design and Manufacturing Workflows
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Describe the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) Framework in Smart Manufacturing
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Understanding the Manufacturing Machine to IT Communications – ex. MT-CONNECT
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Write MT-CONNECT web applications to obtain streaming machine data from CNC machines
                    </li>

            DMDII partnered with some of our members
            a “Specialization” on Coursera. This consists of 9 courses and a capstone. <br />
<br />
A full set of course descriptions including their content can be found at <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/digital-manufacturing-design-technology">https://www.coursera.org/specializations/digital-manufacturing-design-technology</a>. They chose to break courses into individual 7-10 minute lessons, they found this approach encourages learners to work through material in convenient chunks (think while on lunch break, waiting for a bus, some quiet time in the evening, etc.)
<br /><br />
The first 6 courses of the specialization are live! Under each courses webpage you can find a full breakdown of the video and course content that is covered.

						<p class="col-xs-7">
								Whether you’re a high school graduate exploring manufacturing careers, or an operations manager hungry for an understanding of the newest manufacturing technologies, this specialization will provide a foundation in how digital advances are changing the landscape and capabilities of factories. Ten courses – developed with input from the manufacturing industry – touch on digital manufacturing and design practices, the concept of the digital thread, the Internet of Things and Big Data.

                      You can also apply for a “scholarship” by answering a few short answer questions, the scholarships remove the monthly fee tied to receiving a certificate.  The scholarship acceptance rate is quite high and is an attempt by Coursera to drive commitment and completion of the course work. To the right is a screen-shot of the scholarship link location.

                    The National-Level Economic Impact of the MEP
                  </h2>
                  <p> <em>MEP centers provide
                    assistance to primarily small and medium-size manufacturing
                    businesses to help them improve their productivity. As part of
                    the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the
                    MEP centers provide services such as assistance with product
                    development, tools and resources for business expansion, and
                    business continuity planning, which can contribute to cost
                    savings, new investments, and improved products and
                    processes.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p> <em>Each year, NIST MEP surveys their clients using an independent
                    third-party vendor to obtain a reading of the impact of the services
                    provided. Using an economic impact model developed by Regional Economic
                    Models Inc. (REMI), the study forecasts the indirect and induced
                    effects of the reported increase in jobs, sales, cost savings, and
                    investments by MEP clients.</em>
                  </p>


                  <p> <em>The results of the study on the effects of MEP projects of the U.S. economy finds that the $130 million invested in MEP during FY2016 generated nearly a nine-fold increase in
                    federal personal income tax – a 8.7:1 return. Taking into account the competitive interactions among businesses, the REMI model forecasts 142,000 additional jobs and a $15.4 billion
                    increase in GDP during FY2016, when the client-reported effects of MEP projects are included in the model compared to when they are not. </em>
