Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in Cook County, Illinois. in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("<strong>Rules</strong>") of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("<strong>JAMS</strong>"), which are available on the <strong><u><a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/" target="_blank"https://www.jamsadr.com>JAMS website and hereby incorporated by reference</a></u></strong>.

      <p>You and UI LABS agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 16 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the "<strong>FAA</strong>"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.  As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. If you are an individual user, you and UI LABS agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and UI LABS will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs; for any arbitration initiated by UI LABS, UI LABS will pay all JAMS fees and costs. In arbitrations involving entities, the party initiating arbitration will pay the filling fee and the non-prevailing party will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. You and UI LABS agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Illinois and the United States sitting in Cook County, Illinois  have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.</p>

In order to be effective, the opt out notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration.

      <a name="Section18"></a>

      <h1>DMC Platform for App Hosting Service Level Agreement</h1>
            <p style="margin-top:-15px">Last Updated: <strong>September 2016</strong></p>

            <h2>Version 1.1</h2>
            This DMC Service Level Agreement ("SLA") between DMC, Inc. ("DMC", "us" or "we") and users of the DMC Services ("you") governs the use of the DMC Platform under the provisions of the DMC Terms of Service (the "Terms").
            This SLA applies separately to each of your Dedicated Environments, as defined in the Terms. This SLA does not apply to shared environments.
            <p>Unless otherwise provided herein, this SLA is subject to the provisions of the Terms. Capitalized words and phrases have the meaning specified in the Terms. We reserve the right to change the terms of this SLA in accordance with the Terms.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Service Commitment: 92.0% Uptime</h2>
            DMC will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the DMC Platform available with a Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least 92.0% during any monthly billing cycle (the "Service Commitment"). Subject to the DMC SLA Exclusions, if we do not meet the Service Commitment, you will be eligible to receive a Service Credit.
            <p>A Monthly Uptime Percentage of 92.0% means that we guarantee you will experience no more than 2 days, 10 hours 27minutes per month of Unavailability.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
            "DMC Platform" mean your apps and databases running on DMC in Dedicated Environments.
            <p>"Maintenance" means scheduled Unavailability of the DMC Platform, as announced by us prior to the DMC Platform becoming Unavailable.</p>
            <p>"Monthly Uptime Percentage" is calculated by subtracting from 100% the percentage of minutes during the month in which the DMC Platform were Unavailable. Monthly Uptime Percentage measurements exclude downtime resulting directly or indirectly from any DMC SLA Exclusion.</p>
            <p>"Service Credit" means a credit denominated in US dollars, calculated as set forth below, that we may credit back to an eligible account.</p>
            <strong>"Unavailable" and "Unavailability" mean:</strong>
            <ul><li>
            For apps, when all of your apps have no external connectivity
            </li><li>
            For data, when all of your databases have no connectivity, as confirmed by our monitoring.
            </li></ul>
            </p>

            <h2>3. Service Commitments and Service Credits</h2>
            Service Credits are calculated as a percentage of the total charges paid by you (excluding one-time payments, e.g. for training, etc.) for the monthly billing cycle in which the Unavailability occurred in accordance with the schedule below:
            <p>For Monthly Uptime Percentage less than 99.8% but equal to or greater than 99.0%, you will be eligible for a 10% Service Credit.</p>
            <p>For Monthly Uptime Percentage less than 99.0%, you will be eligible for a 30% Service Credit.</p>
            <p>We will apply any Service Credits only against future payments for the Services otherwise due from you. At our discretion, we may issue the Service Credit to the credit card you used to pay for the billing cycle in which the Unavailability occurred. Service Credits will not entitle you to any refund or other payment from DMC. A Service Credit will be applicable and issued only if the credit amount for the applicable monthly billing cycle is greater than one dollar ($1 USD). Service Credits may not be transferred or applied to any other account.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Sole Remedy</h2>
            Unless otherwise provided in the Terms, your sole and exclusive remedy for any unavailability, non-performance, or other failure by us to provide the DMC Platform is the receipt of a Service Credit (if eligible) in accordance with the terms of this SLA.

            <h2>5. Credit Request and Payment Procedures</h2>
            To receive a Service Credit, you must submit a claim by emailing support@ProjectDMC.org. To be eligible, the credit request must be received by us by the end of the second billing cycle after which the incident occurred and must include:
            <ol><li>
            The words "SLA Credit Request" in the subject line;
            </li><li>
            The dates and times of each Unavailability incident that you are claiming;
            </li><li>
            The account handle(s); and
            </li><li>
            logs that document the errors and corroborate your claimed outage (any confidential or sensitive information in these logs should be removed or replaced with asterisks).
      </li></ol>
            <p>If the Monthly Uptime Percentage of such request is confirmed by us and is less than the Service Commitment, then we will issue the Service Credit to you within one billing cycle following the month in which your request is confirmed by us. Your failure to provide the request and other information as required above will disqualify you from receiving a Service Credit.
            </p>

            <h2>6. DMC SLA Exclusions</h2>
            The Service Commitment does not apply to any unavailability, suspension or termination of the DMC Platform, or any other DMC Platform performance issues:
            <ol><li>
            That result from a suspension or Remedial Action, as described in the Terms;
            </li>
            <li>
            Caused by factors outside of our reasonable control, including any force majeure event, Internet access, or problems beyond the demarcation point of the DMC network;
            </li>
            <li>
            That result from any actions or inactions of you or any third party;
            </li>
            <li>
            That result from the equipment, software or other technology of you or any third party (other than third party equipment within our direct control);
            </li>
            <li>
            That result from failures of DMC Platform not attributable to Unavailability; or
            </li>
            <li>
            That result from any Maintenance.
            </li></ol>
            <p>If availability is impacted by factors other than those used in our Monthly Uptime Percentage calculation, then we may issue a Service Credit considering such factors at our discretion.
