  "description":"Torque is a measure of how much a force acting on an object causes that object to rotate. The formula that this model is based on is Torque = r*F*sin(theta). The value r is the distance between the axes of rotation and the point where the force is applied. The value F is the magnitude of the force applied at the lever-arm. The value theta (radians) is the angle at which force is applied to the lever-arm. The value F (Newtons), and r (meter). The output value is Torque (Newton * meters).
